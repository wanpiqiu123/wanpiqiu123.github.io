# About Me

Hi, I am **Jiaming Luo**, you can call me **Leo** anyway.

I got my Bachelor's degree of Computer Science in **Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU)**.

At present I am a Ph.D candate of Computer Science in **Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU)**, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~kzhu/). 

I am quite interested in NLP & Data Science.

I love badminton and curling. I also play Starcraft II and Glory of Kings.

# My Projects

My projects are available on [Github](https://github.com/wanpiqiu123).

## [Acquire](https://github.com/wanpiqiu123/acquire)

I made the digital version of acquire, a classic board game, by pygame. The reason why I made this project is that the old version I used to play with my roommate always crashed. At present this version is quite stable but requires further tests.

## [SJTU-RM](https://github.com/xinyang-go/SJTU-RM-CV-2019)

This is the code of Infantry of SJTU-RoboMaster Team(Jiao Long) in 2019. We finally got Runner-Up in the Final. It is really a great memory in my university life.
